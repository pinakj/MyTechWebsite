        <p>The debate between wired and wireless gaming mice has been raging for years. Gamers have long argued about which is better, with strong opinions on both sides. But in 2025, with advancements in wireless technology, has the gap finally closed? Let's dive deep into the pros and cons of each to help you make the right choice for your gaming setup.</p>

        <p>In this comprehensive comparison, we'll examine performance, battery life, convenience, and value to determine whether wired mice still hold their crown or if wireless has finally won the war. Whether you're a competitive esports player or a casual gamer, this guide will help you understand which option is best for your needs.</p>

        <h2>Performance: The Heart of the Matter</h2>
        <p>For many gamers, performance is the ultimate deciding factor. Let's break down how wired and wireless mice compare in key performance areas:</p>

        <h3>Latency and Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>Historically, wired mice have had a clear advantage in terms of latency. The direct connection ensures that every movement is instantly transmitted to your computer. However, modern wireless mice have largely closed this gap.</p>
        
        <p>Today's top-tier wireless mice use advanced protocols like Logitech's Lightspeed or Razer's HyperSpeed, which offer sub-1ms response times. In blind testing, most users can't distinguish between these and wired mice. For competitive gaming, this means wireless mice are now viable even at the highest levels.</p>

        <h3>Polling Rate and Tracking Accuracy</h3>
        <p>Both wired and wireless mice can achieve high polling rates (1000Hz or higher) and precise tracking. Modern sensors like the PMW3391 or HERO 25K provide exceptional accuracy regardless of connection type.</p>
        
        <p>The key difference lies in consistency. Wired mice maintain a constant connection, while wireless mice may occasionally experience interference from other devices. However, this is increasingly rare with newer models that use dedicated frequency bands.</p>

        <h2>Convenience and Freedom</h2>
        <p>One area where wireless mice clearly excel is convenience. The freedom of movement without a cable tether is liberating, especially for gamers who move around frequently or have multiple setups.</p>

        <h3>Desk Space and Setup Flexibility</h3>
        <p>Wireless mice eliminate the need to manage cables, which can reduce desk clutter and allow for more flexible positioning. You're not limited by cable length, and you can easily move your setup without worrying about cable strain.</p>

        <h3>Travel and Portability</h3>
        <p>For gamers who travel frequently or use laptops, wireless mice are often the preferred choice. There's no cable to tangle in your bag, and setup is as simple as removing a USB receiver or connecting via Bluetooth.</p>

        <h2>Battery Life and Charging</h2>
        <p>Battery life is a critical consideration for wireless mice. Modern wireless mice have made significant improvements in this area:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premium wireless mice:</strong> 50-100+ hours of battery life</li>
            <li><strong>Mid-range wireless mice:</strong> 20-50 hours of battery life</li>
            <li><strong>Wired mice:</strong> No battery concerns, but require a constant connection</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many wireless mice now feature USB-C charging, with some offering days of use from just a few minutes of charging. However, you'll still need to remember to charge them, which can be a downside if you forget and run out of power mid-session.</p>

        <h2>Cost Considerations</h2>
        <p>When comparing similar feature sets, wireless mice typically cost 10-20% more than their wired counterparts. This price difference reflects the additional technology required for wireless connectivity and battery management.</p>

        <p>However, the convenience and freedom of wireless mice may justify the extra cost for many users. Additionally, some manufacturers offer "combo"
